## Enter the Minecraft world

1. Open Minecraft Pi from the main menu. Start a game and create a new world.

2. Walk around using the WSAD keys on the keyboard. Use space to jump, and double tap space to fly.

3. Press Tab and the keyboard to release your mouse cursor, and open Python 3 from the main menu.

4. Move your windows around so Minecraft and Python are side-by-side.
